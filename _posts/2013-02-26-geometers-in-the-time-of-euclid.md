title: Like geometers in the time of Euclid

I just came across this video of my computer science lecturer.

“You are like geometers and you’re living in the time of Euclid.”

He said the same thing to conclude the final lecture when I took this class in winter 2005, and the big picture of why we study this stuff just clicked for me. I do believe that Mehran Sahami has influenced *generations* of Stanford students.
