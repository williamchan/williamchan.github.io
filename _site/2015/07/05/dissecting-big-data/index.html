  <h1 class="post-title">Dissecting the "big data" industry</h1>
  <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2015</span>
  <p>At a friend&#39;s recent bbq, I was peppered with questions from VC and corporate professionals trying to wrap their heads around &quot;big data.&quot; I don&#39;t blame them. There is so much press about companies doing all sorts of things that fall under the umbrella of &quot;big data.&quot;</p>

<p>At first glance, it may look like many &quot;big data&quot; companies are doing the same thing. The fact that similar marketing language is used across the industry does not help the situation. Aspirational phases like &quot;democratizes data analytics&quot; and enabling &quot;data-driven decision making&quot; abound.</p>

<p>To understand a data company&#39;s market, understand the intended user and <strong>intended use cases</strong>. What does the tool enable the user to do that they could not do before? The use cases can often be characterized as retrieval, preparation, or analysis -- three phases of a simplified data pipeline. Many innovative companies today are tackling one or more of those functions.</p>

<p>Also, understand what <strong>kind of data</strong> the company operates on. &quot;Data&quot; is an opaque label until you know whether we are talking about human-entered form data, automatically-generated event logs, stock market data, or something else. Since the data and its use cases are two sides of the same coin, this should be a short hop. By then, you should already be on your way to discerning the borderlines of &quot;big data&quot; and its sub-industries.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s walk through some examples together.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Splunk was founded to pursue a disruptive new vision: make machine data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone&quot;</em>: Conveniently for us, <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a> names the kind of data it works with. Machine data is typically data that is automated generated by computers. Its users are those teams that are closest to that machine data: the IT staff (think sysadmins) who use that data to understand what is happening on the company&#39;s web properties. Splunk also provides intuitive features such as dashboards and alerts so that business users have also become users of Splunk-prepared machine data (think marketing departments understanding user cohorts).</p>

<p><em>&quot;On a mission to help people see and understand data&quot;</em>: <a href="http://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>&#39;s tools are made for non-technical business users to visualize almost any kind of data. Their website does mention &quot;data prep for messy spreadsheets,&quot; meaning that they have stepped into the data preparation function, but Tableau&#39;s primary focus is on data analysis by way of visualization.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Interactive, self-service data preparation&quot;</em>: <a href="http://www.paxata.com/">Paxata</a> focuses exclusively on data preparation functions and enabling non-technical users to do it themselves without the help of IT staff. Messy data that has been prepared with Paxata can then feed into Tableau visualizations that are more accurate and meaningful, for example. Paxata talks about serving data scientists as well as data analysts, but the interactive interface enables non-technical people to do tasks that previously required a technical professional aka data scientist. (I work here.)</p>

<p><em>&quot;The only end-to-end solution native on Hadoop&quot;</em>: <a href="http://www.platfora.com/">Platfora</a> tries to do everything from retrieval to preparation to analysis on the data that enterprises store in Hadoop. &quot;No developers needed&quot; implies that the intended user is non-technical.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Data fusion platforms for integrating, managing, and securing any kind of data ... we layer applications for fully interactive, human-driven, machine-assisted analysis&quot;</em>: <a href="https://www.palantir.com/products/">Palantir</a> also does everything from retrieval to preparation to analysis, with one product for enterprise data and another for quantitative data. How does Palantir load customer data into their products and prepare it for analysis? From my understanding, they do so with custom code written by forward-deployed engineers.</p>

<p>To wrap up this short tour, I&#39;ll just mention some other hot and exciting companies: <a href="http://confluent.io/">Confluent</a>, <a href="https://www.databricks.com">Databricks</a>, and <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a>. For all of them, their solutions are for a very technical audience, pretty much for software engineers that can incorporate advances in distributed computing to solve their engineering problems. In addition, Cloudera offers support to enable non-tech enterprises to use &quot;big data&quot; technologies, a common business channel for open-source software companies.</p>

<p>Understanding <em>what</em> a company does is just step one in seeing where the industry is going. These companies build quickly, thereby introducing rapid changes to the map of who competes with whom as well as what each company&#39;s competitive advantages are.</p>
